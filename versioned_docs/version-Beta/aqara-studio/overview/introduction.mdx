# Introduction

## What is Aqara Studio?

Aqara Studio is a professional, customizable IoT platform developed by Aqara. Built with a native ontology-driven approach, it leverages a graph-based data storage architecture to establish an open foundation and deeply integrates multi-protocol and cross-ecosystem connectivity. 

The system fully supports mainstream industrial control protocols such as KNX/IP and BACnet/IP, breaking down device connectivity barriers. It also seamlessly integrates Aqara native devices, Matter-certified devices, and third-party devices including Home Assistant. 

With its graphical automation programming and local operation & maintenance features, Aqara Studio effectively resolves core issues found in traditional automation systems—enabling seamless wired and wireless integration, flexible expansion and upgrade, and advanced intelligent transformation.

## What are the core features?

### Graph-Driven Architecture, Powering Intelligent Collaboration

The system is built on a graph-based data storage architecture centered on an entity-relationship model. This architecture naturally represents complex IoT device topologies and hierarchical structures. It provides a solid foundation for unified modeling and efficient access to heterogeneous data.

A unified data abstraction layer semantically standardizes device models across protocols and vendors. This eliminates ecosystem data silos and enables an open, ecosystem-compatible foundation. The platform also provides flexible and extensible modeling capabilities for diverse scenarios. Users can quickly define device attributes, relationships, and automation logic as needed. This establishes a strong foundation for centralized device management and intelligent cross-domain collaboration.

### Multi-Protocol Integration, Breaking Connectivity Barriers

Built around multi-protocol integration and bidirectional data flow, the platform delivers an open, full-scenario intelligent architecture. It fully supports mainstream building and industrial control protocols such as KNX/IP, BACnet/IP, and Modbus, fundamentally eliminating connectivity barriers between heterogeneous devices and enabling seamless interoperability between legacy systems and modern intelligent upgrades.

### Multi-Ecosystem Integration for Seamless Collaboration

The system seamlessly integrates Aqara devices, Matter-certified devices, and third-party ecosystems such as Home Assistant. Combined with the Aqara Home App, users can easily discover devices, perform remote control, and configure automations, delivering a flexible and efficient smart experience for both commercial and residential environments.

### Plug-in-Based Extensibility, Scaling on Demand

The platform adopts a flexible, plug-in-based architecture. Through the Aqara Builder community, a rich set of plugins will be made available, supporting free installation, updates, and combinations. This enables on-demand functional expansion and precise adaptation to advanced, highly customized user scenarios.

### Visual Programming for Efficient Development

A zero-code, drag-and-drop visual programming experience is provided, along with a rich library of logic components. Even non-professional users can get started quickly, while real-time debugging and visual feedback significantly improve automation development efficiency.

### Graphical Configuration with Low-Code Deployment

Zero-code drag-and-drop configuration is combined with built-in visual components and industry-specific templates. The system supports real-time data binding and responsive layouts, greatly lowering development barriers and effectively shortening project delivery cycles.

### Secure, Reliable, and Stable Operation

Core data is managed through local deployment, forming a closed-loop data architecture reinforced by multiple layers of encryption and access control. Cloud backup and end-to-end encryption are also supported, meeting compliance requirements and delivering a comprehensive security model that combines local control with cloud-based disaster recovery.
