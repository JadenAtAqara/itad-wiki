# Introduction

## What is Aqara Studio?

Aqara Studio facilitates intuitive logic orchestration (Logic Flow), graphic editing, and visualization capabilities (Graph), which supports a wide range of protocol plugin extensions. This allows operators to design more complex automation scenarios, meeting the high-end smart needs of commercial spaces, large residential areas, and more.

## What are the core features?

### Integrating Multiple Protocols to Create a Unified, Cohesive Smart Environment

Aqara Studio supports mainstream IoT communication protocols such as KNX/IP, BACnet, OPC UA, Modbus, and MQTT as the centralized platform for smart building integration. It is compatible with the Aqara Link protocol and Zigbee sub-devices, breaking down communication barriers between different brands and types of devices in both residential and commercial buildings. Whether it's an aging wired system or new wireless smart devices, Aqara Studio meets the needs of system expansions, upgrades, and intelligent transformations.

### Multi-Ecosystem Integration for a Unified, Open, and Intelligent Environment 

Aqara Studio supports the unified integration of Aqara devices, Matter-compatible Aqara devices, Home Assistant devices, and other third-party devices based on mainstream protocols. Users can also remote control devices, access their queries, monitor their status, and configure automation scenes through the Aqara Home app, delivering a cross-brand, cross-protocol smart space experience.

### Visual Logic Programming: Simplifying and Enhancing Automations

Aqara's visual logic programming feature a comprehensive library of logic components (such as arithmetic, logical, time functions, and scripts). Through a graphic interface, , it transforms complex code logic into intuitive drag-and-drop modules, allowing users to assemble functional blocks like building LEGOs. With its zero-code, high-usability characteristics, even non-professional users can quickly learn automation control, building complete systems without advanced training. Additionally, it supports real-time debugging and visual feedback, enabling developers to monitor the execution status of each node, significantly improving development efficiency.

### Build Smart Control Dashboards Visually Without Coding or Complexity.

The graphical configuration capability uses a zero-code visual design, enabling users to quickly build professional Web-based dashboards or mobile H5 pages through intuitive drag-and-drop and configurations without programming. The system offers a wide range of visual components (such as gauges, buttons, trend charts, etc.) and industry templates, graphically displaying data in real-time using a customizable layout. This significantly reduces development barriers and shortens project timelines.

### All-in-One AI Assistant, Making Interaction Simpler

Aqara Studio features an AI assistant with powerful intelligent interaction and automated decision-making capabilities. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning technologies, it accurately understands user needs and provides real-time responses. It helps users quickly grasp Aqara Studio's product features, analyzing various types of data, and presenting results through components like charts. Additionally, it assists users in tasks such as creating automations via text input.

### Security and Reliability to Ensure Stable Operations

Aqara Studio adopts a localized deployment model, so core data and business processing remains entirely closed within the enterprise. It safeguards data sovereignty through multi-layered encryption and access control mechanisms while supporting cloud-based backups for disaster recovery. The system employs a certificate-based security authentication mechanism, meeting both the security and convenience requirements of remote operation and maintenance. It also supports end-to-end communication encryption and protection against cyberattacks, forming a security framework of "local autonomy and control + cloud-based disaster recovery collaboration" that fully complies with cybersecurity regulatory standards.

## How Does the System Architecture Work?

Aqara Studio uses a hybrid system architecture that combines distributed and centralized approaches. This flexible design can meet different network needs and supports multi-level distributed networking. The system allows cloud, edge, and terminal devices to work together, ensuring smooth data connections and supporting a wide range of applications in any network environment.

- **Hybrid Architecture**: The hybrid structure is as flexible and reliable as distributed systems. also, its centralized management simplifies the operation and maintenance.
- **Multi-level Distributed Networks**: Networks can be set up in multiple layers and adjusted for different project sizes and complexities.
- **Cloud-Edge-Terminal Deployment**: Aqara Studio works on both cloud and edge. It offers a unified management plan to keep both data handling and transfer efficient and safe.
- **Fulfilling Various Needs**: In large campuses, smart buildings, or homes, Aqara Studio works well in different network environments, from basic connections to advanced data analysis.

## What Are the Key Advantages?

- **Seamless Integration**: Aqara Studio supports you to connect and manage devices from different brands and platforms across multiple protocols. This makes it easy to unify smart home and building systems.
- **Open Ecosystem**: You can integrate with Aqara, Matter, Home Assistant, and other mainstream third-party devices, creating a truly open smart environment.
- **User-Friendly Design**: With visual logic programming and drag-and-drop dashboards, you can quickly set up automations and data displays without any coding.
- **Intelligent Interaction**: The built-in AI assistant supports natural language commands and provides intelligent recommendations, making the system easier and smarter to use.
- **Strong Security**: Aqara Studio uses local deployment with cloud backup, strict access controls, and data encryption to keep your data safe and your business running smoothly.
- **Flexible and Scalable**: The hybrid architecture combines distributed and centralized networking, so the system can flexibly scale and adapt to projects of all sizes and requirements.
