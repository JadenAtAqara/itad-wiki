### Configuration Process

After adding a device component to the canvas, please follow the configuration steps below:

1. **(Required) Link a real device**  
   Select the component, switch to the **Data** tab, find the **Data Configuration** section, and link this component to a real device.

2. **(Optional) Customize display information**  
   Still under the **Data** tab, go to the **Card Info** section to configure and adjust the device information shown on the interface. The main configuration items include:

   | Item         | Description                                                                                       |
   |--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Device Name  | The name displayed on the interface. You can inherit the device’s original name (default) or customize it for easier identification and management. |
   | Room         | Space where the device belongs. Automatically gets the actual room info (default), or customize as needed. |
   | Status Info  | Real-time display of specific device statuses (such as switch, mode, etc.). You can hide this if not needed. |

3. **(Optional) Style customization**  
   If the default style does not meet your requirements, go to the **Style** tab and customize in the **Card Configuration** section. Two configuration modes are supported:

   - **Basic config:** Quickly modify the styles of main elements (such as `device icon`, `switch icon`, and `card font`) for all statuses with one click. This is simple and efficient for common scenarios.
   - **Senior:** Customize the appearance for different device statuses (such as on, off, abnormal, etc.) separately, with more detailed property options (icons, font, background color, etc.), making it suitable for more complex or personalized visual designs.

By following these steps, you can flexibly configure and beautify device components based on your business needs, achieving both practicality and appealing visuals.

3. Click the **Edit Data Source** button. In the pop-up window, double-click the data source you need and click **Confirm** to bind it.
4. In the **Settings Drawer**, find **Cycle**. Choose the **Enum options** and set the data time range you want the chart to show (such as Today, 24 hours, or Yesterday).

If the default chart style does not fit your data well after configuration, you can adjust the appearance of the chart.

### Adjust Chart Styles

You can adjust the appearance of the chart in the **Component Configuration** section of the **Style** tab. There are basic settings and advanced settings.

Base config are the same for all chart types: you can set the font style for all text, as well as the font size for tooltips and legends.

Advanced configs offer different options depending on the chart type, providing more detailed customization:

## Table

The table component helps display various device or business data on the canvas in a structured way. It is suitable for comparing information, showing batches of data, or viewing detailed data records. Aqara Studio provides both data tables and alarm tables. You can flexibly configure their content and style to efficiently manage and visualize data.

This section explains how to configure different types of table components so you can quickly build the data tables you need.

### Data Table

The data table component is used to display static data. Follow these steps to configure it:

1. Select the data table component to open the **Settings Drawer**, then switch to the **Data** tab.
2. Edit `Custom table data`. In the popup, add or delete table rows and columns, and freely edit the content of each cell.
3. When finished editing, click **Confirm**. You will see the table preview on the canvas in real time.


### Alarm Table

The alarm table component displays alarm data from Aqara Studio. You can use it immediately without extra setup or data binding. In this table, you can view alarm time, alarm ID, alarm source status, and more. This allows you to quickly check and monitor alarms, making it easy to locate and handle abnormal situations and improve system maintenance efficiency.

If you need to show more alarm details in the table (such as the user who acknowledged the alarm or the acknowledgment status), follow these steps:

1. Select the alarm table component and go to the **Settings Drawer**, then switch to the **Data** tab.
2. Click the **Table configuration > Column configuration** button.
3. In the popup, click **Add column**. At the bottom, a new row will appear. Now you can name the new column, select the data type as `Basic column`, and bind the required data source.
4. After configuring, click Confirm. The new column will be added to the alarm table and bound to the data.

### Common Table Settings

Both data tables and alarm tables support the following data item settings in **Table Settings**:

| Property         | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| Filter data | Set filtering rules for different data. |
| Function settings | Adjust interactivity, layout, and style of the table. |
| Cycle           | Set the time range of the data shown in the table (such as Today, 24 hours, or Last 7 days). |
| Limit            | Set the maximum number of rows displayed in the table. |
| Sort            | Configure data to be shown in ascending or descending order. |
| Automatically Refresh  Data    | Choose whether the table data auto refreshes at intervals. |
| Refresh Interval | If auto refresh is enabled, define the refresh time interval. |

## Media

Media components let you display rich multimedia content on the big screen, mainly via the video player. You can embed external videos into the interface, supporting many popular video formats. This enhances the display and interactivity of your dashboard. You can flexibly set the video source as needed for different display scenarios.

### Video Player

This component supports playing **external video** on the big screen. To configure:

1. Click the component, open the **Settings Drawer**, and switch to the **Data** tab.
2. Set **Type** to `Custom`. In **Custom Data**, enter the external video’s URL (make sure the URL meets the requirements below).
   :::tip
   The video URL must meet these requirements:   
   - Direct access: The URL must point directly to the video file itself (only `.mp4`, `.flv`, and `.m3u8` formats are supported). The video must be accessible on the public network. URLs for video sites (like Youku, Tencent Video, etc.) are not supported.
   - Protocol consistency: If your dashboard is accessed via HTTPS, your video URL should also use HTTPS to avoid mixed content issues.
   - CORS setting: If the video is stored on a third-party server, ensure cross-origin access (CORS) is allowed. Otherwise, the player may not play the video.
   - Smooth playback: For a better user experience, make sure the video file is not too large and uses a reasonable bitrate.
   :::
3. Switch to the **Style** tab, and set the **video mode** that matches the video format to ensure normal playback and the best display.

## Other

Besides the components mentioned above, Aqara Studio also provides some additional components to enhance the dashboard, including Dropdown and Timer.

### Dropdown

The dropdown component provides a convenient dropdown menu for your screen. Users can choose different options to quickly jump to a specified external website. This enables flexible page linking and many extension scenarios.

After adding a dropdown component, configure URLs as follows:
1. Select the component. Open the **Settings Drawer** and switch to the **Data** tab.
2. In **Tag configuration**, click the **+** button to add a new tab for the dropdown.
3. Expand the new tab. You can customize its name, configure its URL, and select how to open the URL.
4. If you want to add more options, repeat the above steps.

### Timer

The timer component can show the current time on the screen in real time, making your data more timely and readable.

After adding the timer component, follow these steps to set the display format:

1. Select the timer component and go to the **Settings Drawer**, then switch to the **Style** tab.
2. Under **Timer > Format**, select the date and time format you want (such as `yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm`), so you can match different display requirements.
