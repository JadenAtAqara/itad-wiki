# Components

## Overview

The component library contains a variety of basic and extended components for large-screen design. You can flexibly build interfaces to meet real-world needs by dragging, dropping, and configuring components. Common types include device, text, shapes, buttons, borders, and more. There are also controls for displaying and interacting with data, actions, and statuses. This helps meet various data visualization and interaction requirements.

## Common Properties

All components and materials share the same properties. These include style (such as size, position, color, etc.) and action (such as click event configurations). For details, see [Common Properties of Components and Materials](./common-properties.mdx).

## Component Types

Component types include **device**, **basic component**, **control**, **basic chart**, **table**, **media**, and **others**. For details about each component, please refer to [Component Categories](./component-categories.mdx).

## Favorite Components

To quickly access components you use frequently, click the ⭐️ star icon at the top right of a component in the library. The component will then appear in the “favorites” section in the left navigation panel.

To remove from favorites, simply click the ⭐️ star icon again.

## Set Components as Materials

After finishing a component’s **style** configuration, if you want to reuse its style in other graphs, right-click the component in the library and select **Set widget material**. The system will save the current configuration as material. You can find it in "Material Library - Single component material" for easy use later.
