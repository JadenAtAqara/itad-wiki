# Graph Web

## Overview

Graph web is an important platform in smart home management. It is used for centralized display, monitoring, and interaction with various system statuses and business data. Aqara Studio allows users to create their own Graph web pages based on business needs. You can customize pages for device status monitoring, control panels, scenario triggers, automation operations, and data analysis. All kinds of system data and actions – including devices, scenes, and automation flows – can be integrated into one interactive and customizable page. This makes visual operation and management easier, and improves intelligent coordination and decision making.
