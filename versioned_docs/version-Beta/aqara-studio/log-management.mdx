# Log Management

Select **Log Audit** in the sidebar to access the following three types of logs: [Device Log](#device-log), [Link Log](#link-log), and [User Operation Log](#user-operation-log). These logs provide detailed data to support system operation and security audits.

- **Device Log**: The device log records all changes in the function point values of devices, allowing you to track device status and operation history.
- **Link Log**: The link log includes the connection status and target IP information for Aqara Studio and various protocols.
- **User Operation Log**: The user operation log comprehensively records user logins and operation behaviors, making it easy to trace activities and clarify responsibilities.

All logs support time filtering and keyword search, meeting daily operation and audit requirements.

By default, Aqara Studio displays logs from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59 of the current day. To view historical logs, please manually select the desired time range.
