# Data Export API v1

Aqara provides the Data Export API v1, which allows you to access device data from the Studio system and perform secondary development.

The API supports querying and subscribing to device data, device control, device add/delete event notifications, and scene list queries.

## Communication Protocols

The Studio API supports two main protocols: [HTTP](#http-request-url) and [WebSocket](#websocket-request-url).

#### Request Details

The request URL format varies depending on whether [remote access](./../remote-access.mdx) is enabled.

##### HTTP Request URL

**Request method**: POST   
**Request URL format**: 
- Remote access disabled: `http://<local_LAN_IP>/open/api/v1`
- Remote access enabled: `http://<remote_access_address>/open/api/v1`

##### WebSocket Request URL

**Request URL format**: 
- Remote access disabled: `ws://<local_LAN_IP>/open/ws`
- Remote access enabled: `ws://<remote_access_address>/open/ws`

After you establish a connection, you can send and receive JSON messages in real time with the server.

##### Request Headers

| Parameter      | Type   | Required         | Description   |
| -------------- | ------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Authorization  | String | Required for HTTP and WebSocket | Authorization Token for user authentication.<br />Format is `Bearer <token>`. Replace `<token>` with the token you obtained from Aqara Studio. (If the token from Aqara Studio already includes the Bearer prefix, use it directly without adding another Bearer.) For more details on how to get the token, see [Developer Guide - Obtain Required Information](./../developer-guide.mdx#obtain-required-information). |
| Content-Type   | String | HTTP only        | Default is `application/json`.  |



## Error Handling

If you receive an error response after making an API request, don’t worry. The error message will help you troubleshoot and solve the issue.

Below is an example to help you quickly understand and resolve problems:

```json
{
    "type": "ErrorMessage",
    "version": "v1",
    "msgId": "UNKNOWN",
    "code": 1000,
    "message": "Message parsing failed: Unexpected JSON token at offset 0: Serializer for subclass 'GetDeviceInfo' is not found in the polymorphic scope of 'WebSocketMessageRequest' at path: $\nCheck if class with serial name 'GetDeviceInfo' exists and serializer is registered in a corresponding SerializersModule.\nTo be registered automatically, class 'GetDeviceInfo' has to be '@Serializable', and the base class 'WebSocketMessageRequest' has to be sealed and '@Serializable'.\nJSON input: {\n    \"type\": \"GetDeviceInfo\",....."
}
```

1. **Check the `type` field**

    First, look at the **`type`** field in the response. All failed requests will have **`ErrorMessage`** as the value.

2. **Check the `msgId` field**

    If there was a format error in your request, the **`msgId`** will usually be **`UNKNOWN`**, which means the server did not recognize a valid request ID.

3. **Carefully read the `message` field for details**

    The **`message`** field provides detailed error information. It usually includes the most important clues, for example, missing parameters or data type mistakes. Read this carefully to figure out the precise issue and how to fix it.
