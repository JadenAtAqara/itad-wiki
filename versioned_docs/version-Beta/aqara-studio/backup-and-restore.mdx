# Backup and Restore

Aqara Studio supports backing up user data, helping you quickly recover operations and ensure data security by restoring backup data in the event of service failures or operational errors.

## Backup Data

Navigate to the **Backup and Restore** page from the sidebar to [start backup](#start-backup) and [manage backups](#manage-backups).

### Start Backup

Aqara Studio uses a full backup mechanism that completely backs up user data. You can use two methods to back up: automatic backup and manual backup.

| Backup Method | Description | Operation |
| - | - | - |
| Automatic Backup | You can set up a backup interval, and the system will automatically create backups according to this schedule. | Click "Local Auto-Backup Settings" to configure the following parameters:<br />1. **Enable** automatic backup.<br />2. Set the start date and time for automatic backups.<br />3. Set the maximum number of backup files allowed.<br />4. **Save** your configuration. |
| Manual Backup | Instantly back up by triggering a manual backup. | Click "Manual Backup". |

### Manage Backups

After successful backup, you can see the backup on the backup list, and perform the following actions:
- Reset: Restore the system data to this backup.
- Download: Download the backup for local management.
- Delete: Delete this backup.

## Restore Data

You can restore user data using either of the following methods:
- Select any backup file and click "Reset" to restore data from that backup.
