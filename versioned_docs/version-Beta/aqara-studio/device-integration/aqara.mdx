This guide explains how to connect Aqara devices to Aqara Studio through Aqara Cloud.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure:
- You have already added your Aqara devices to the Aqara Home App.
- Both your Aqara device and the Aqara Edge Hub M300 are in the same home in the Aqara Home App and connected to the same WiFi network.

### Add Devices

1. In the left sidebar, go to the **Devices** page.
2. In the device tree on the left, select **Aqara**, then switch to the **Add Device** tab.
3. Click **Discover Devices**; Aqara Studio will automatically retrieve devices from your Aqara Home App via Aqara Cloud.
4. After selecting the devices you wish to add, click the "+" button in the center. The newly added devices will appear in the **Added Device List** on the right, and will also be visible under Aqara on the left device tree.
