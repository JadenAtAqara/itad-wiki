# Automation



## Overview

Automation is an intelligent scenario feature provided by Aqara Studio that helps you achieve linkage control and automatic response between devices. For example, when a thermostat detects that the room temperature exceeds 30°C, the air conditioner will automatically turn on.

With flexible visual configuration capabilities, Aqara Studio enables you to quickly build automation flows suitable for various scenarios, easily realizing smart control and collaboration of IoT devices.

## Key Advantages

- **Flexible Orchestration**: Modular design supports free combination of logic, math, and control functions, adapting to diverse IoT scenarios.
- **Intuitive Operation**: Graphical data connection interface lowers configuration barriers and improves development efficiency.
- **Real-time Effectiveness**: Configurations take effect immediately upon completion—no need to restart devices or the system.

## Supported Modes

Aqara Studio supports you in creating the following three automation modes:
