# Energy Management System

## Overview

Aqara Studio tracks and aggregates energy device data. It supports daily, weekly, and monthly energy reports and trends. The Energy Management System(EMS) dashboard shows total energy, trends, and top-consuming spaces and devices. You can view patterns by space, device, or device type.

This feature helps you see real-time energy use in all areas. It helps spot energy waste and abnormal consumption. You can take action to save energy or optimize use.

The dashboard makes all energy data easier to view in one place. It supports future analysis, alerting, and device maintenance.
