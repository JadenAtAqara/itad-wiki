# Developer Guide


This document is designed to help developers expand the platform’s capabilities, enabling deep integration and custom development. Whether you want to build personalized applications using the API, or connect devices to mainstream smart home systems, you will find detailed guidance here.

Before starting to use the API v1, you need to [obtain the Studio’s local IP address and Token](#obtain-required-information). This information is required for request URLs and authentication.

## Obtain Required Information

Before using the API v1, you must first get the Studio’s local IP address and Token. These details are used for composing the request URL and for authentication.

Follow these steps:

1. Log in to Aqara Studio. Click into the "Developer" page from the left sidebar.
2. In the **Data Export API** section, you can directly find the local IP address.
3. **Enable** the Data Export API, then click the **Get Token** button to copy your Token.

## Call the API

With the complete API, you can programmatically obtain device data, control devices, and subscribe to real-time messages. You may want to:
- Query the device list and their status.
- Remotely control device operations.
- Integrate device data into your own system.
- Develop a customized device management experience.

Please refer to the [API documentation](./api-references/data-export-api-v1.mdx) for detailed API descriptions and usage instructions.
