# Add Tags

To help you organize and identify devices and Points in your smart home system, Aqara Studio lets you add different types of tags to protocols, devices or points. This improves both the structure and efficiency of device management.

## Tag Types

Aqara Studio offers two kinds of tags: [mark tags](#mark-tag) and [property tags](#property-tag).

- **Mark tag**: Used for identifying and classifying, protocols, devices and points. You cannot assign a value to a mark tag.
- **Property tag**: It allows you to set a value. You can use it to describe specific properties of a protocol, device or point.

## How to Add Tags
