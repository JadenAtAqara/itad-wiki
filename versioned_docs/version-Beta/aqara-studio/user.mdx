# User

After logging into Aqara Studio with the default account, go to the **User** page in the left sidebar to [add](#add-users) and [delete](#delete-users) users, [edit user information](#edit-user-information), [reset user passwords](#reset-password), and [add user groups](#add-user-groups).

## Basic Concepts

Before managing users, it is helpful to understand two core concepts: "user roles" and "user groups." These will assist you in efficiently assigning permissions and managing accounts.

### User Roles

Aqara Studio comes with three built-in user roles, each with different permission scopes. When creating a new user, the role must be assigned by the super admin. The roles and their permissions are described in the following table:

| Role    | Permission Scope |
| ------- | --------------- |
| Super admin   | <ul><li>User management (add, delete, edit users)</li><li>License management</li><li>Full read/write access to all features and data without any restrictions.</li></ul> |
| Admin   | After authorization from the super admin, the role has read and write access to assigned features and data. |
| Operator| After authorization from the super admin, the role has read-only access to assigned features and data. |

### User Groups

A user group is used to batch assign roles and permissions, making user management more convenient and efficient. When multiple users are added to the same user group, they share the same set of permissions.

### Permission Overlay

After joining a user group, a user's personal role and permissions are combined with those of the user group. The effective permissions are the sum of both.

## Add Users

1. Open the **User Management** tab and click the **Add** button.

2. Fill in the required information such as username and role in the popup, then click **Confirm** to add the user.

3. The system will display a prompt indicating the user was added successfully and automatically generate an initial password for the new user. Please keep this password safe.

4. Return to the user list, and in the row for the new user, click the **Edit icon**. In the **User Information** popup, switch to the **Access Permission** tab.

5. In the **Access Permission** tab, select the functions the user can access, then click **Confirm** to save the settings.

6. The first time the new user logs into Aqara Studio with their username and initial password, the system will require them to change their password to ensure account security.

## Delete Users

Open the **User Management** tab, find the row for the target user, and click the **Delete icon** to remove the user.

## Add User Groups

1. Open the **User Group** tab and click the **Add** button.

2. In the popup, enter the group name, assign roles (multiple can be selected), and optionally add users. Click **Confirm** to create the user group.

## Edit User Information

Open **User Management**, find the row for the target user, and click the :pen: icon to edit the user's basic information, custom settings, and access permissions.
- Basic information: nickname, role, user group, language, email, phone number.

## Reset Password
